/**
 * LeetCode 337. House Robber III
 *
 * The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again.
 * There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root,
 * each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour,
 * the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree".
 * It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
 *
 * Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
 *
 *      3
 *     / \
 *    2   3
 *     \   \
 *      3   1
 *
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
